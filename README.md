# MNIST
This repository contains code and resources for training a machine learning model on the famous MNIST dataset. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, widely used as a benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) and corresponding labels indicating the digit shown in each image. It contains 42,000 training samples and 28,000 testing samples. The dataset is frequently used for image classification tasks and is an excellent starting point for learning machine learning concepts.
